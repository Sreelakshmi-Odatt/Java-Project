## Features

- **Inheritance:** Utilizes inheritance to create a hierarchy of classes, demonstrating the "is-a" relationship between them.

- **Polymorphism:** Illustrates polymorphic behavior through method overriding and interfaces, allowing objects of different classes to be treated interchangeably.

- **Abstraction:** Implements abstraction by defining abstract classes and methods, providing a foundation for building specialized classes.
